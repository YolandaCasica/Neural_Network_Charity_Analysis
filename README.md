## Summary

Overall, by increasing the accuracy above 75% we are able to correctly classify each of the points in the test data 75% of the time. And, an applicant has a 80% chance of being successful if they have the following:
* The NAME of the applicant appears more than 5 times (they have applied more than 5 times)
* The type of APPLICATION is one of the following; T3, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T10, and T19
* The application has the following CLASSIFICATION; C1000, C2000, C3000, C1200, and C2100.

A good model to recommend is the Random Forest model because Random Forest are good for classification problems. Using this model produces a 78% accuracy.
